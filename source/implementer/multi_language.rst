Multiple Language Support
=========================

In OpenCHS right from the beginning we want include the support for multiple languages. We use the multi-language support provided in
OpenMRS. Hence the translations to different languages can be provided in the concept. The application specific labels/text are also
internationalised and loaded from the server.
